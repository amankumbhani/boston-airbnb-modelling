## Installation
<a id='installation'></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using AirBnB's Boston Dataset to find out;
1. In which month do prices peak for listings?
2. Do superhosts outperform hosts?
3. Does property type affect pricing?
4. What features of the dataset can be used to better predict the price of listings?

## File Descriptions
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
Boston Data - contains 3 files;
1. reviews.csv - Contains the reviews for each listing
2. listings.csv - Contains the listing details
3. calendars.csv - Contains the availability and price for all listings around the year

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://amankumbhani.medium.com/this-analysis-will-make-you-take-a-trip-with-airbnb-3d2aca5a5fc6).
